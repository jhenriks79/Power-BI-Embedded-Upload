# Power-BI-Helper

This project demonstrates how to use Azure Functions to handle HTTP requests which wrap the Power BI Embedded APIs for creating Workspaces and importing a PBIX file in the Azure Portal.  The "create-workspace" is needed for the "create-workspace" function.  The "import-report" folder is needed for the "import-report" function.  The "core" folder contains all the shared objects and functions.
